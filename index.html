            <p class="font">The emergence of the online food delivery services could be attributed to the changing
                nature of urban consumers. These consumers use food delivery services for a variety of reasons but,
                unsurprisingly, the most common reason seems to be the need for quick and convenient meals during or
                after a busy work day. </p>
